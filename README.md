# 🖼️ Image Translation on Cartesian Plane using Python

This project demonstrates how to translate an image (or a detected shape within it) on a **Cartesian coordinate system** using **Python**, with visualization of the original and translated positions. Built using **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, this Jupyter Notebook is ideal for understanding basic geometric transformations in image processing.

## 📌 Features

- Reads and displays an input image  
- Detects and centers shapes within the image  
- Applies **translation (shifting)** on a 2D Cartesian plane  
- Visualizes original and translated positions side by side  
- Interactive and easy to understand in a Jupyter Notebook format

## 🛠 Requirements

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
